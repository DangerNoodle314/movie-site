  <p>The movie, "The Ritual" directed by David Bruckner; and written by Joe Barton and Adam Nevill. This movie starts out fast; the lowers into an excellent crescendo of pace. It starts out as a regular hiking trip, the group is about half way when a member gets severely injured. As their tended too, other for a plan to for go the trail all together and cut through the forest. A rational plan, for time and getting the injured back to the resort. Here to the end of the movie, we watch as each rational decision only brings more trouble. What was going to be a shortcut turned into a nightmare. The group doesn't make stupid decisions either as other horror and suspense movies. "The Ritual" has an excellent way to raise the hairs on your own neck as a viewer. We have an omnipresence in the movie, we as the viewer see more than the Characters. Small hints to the thing thats stalking, and waiting to strike. As it herds the group, unknowingly, to it's lair. A gripping heart pounding experience for the viewers. </p>
